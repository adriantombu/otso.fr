# My magnificent personal website

This is the repository of my personal website. Nothing fancy here, just pure HTML and CSS because I'm too lazy to maintain anything else.

If you don't care looking at this [state of the art website](https://otso.fr), you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantombu/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adriantombu).

By the way, I'm Adrian, freelance tech lead, nice to meet you!
