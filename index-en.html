    <h1>Senior Back-End Tech Lead</h1>

    <hr />

    <p><abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr></p>
    <p>Adrian Tombu - Freelance back end Tech Lead (Rust, Typescript) - Remote only - 4 days week</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I welcome you, dear visitor, into this bare but nevertheless interesting page which is a <b>personnal tribute</b> to the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> of my youth.</p>
    <p>Here you won't find any Google Fonts or jQuery. Even less of Node.js, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> or Jekyll. This page is the quintessence of the Internet: an HTML page as we like.</p>
    <p><small>And yes, that website is a troll to all of the templates and CMS I have used in my life</small></p>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Adrian Tombu</b>, French-Belgian of profession (with a strong penchant for Abbey brown beer), born developer during the unforgettable year of 1986: <b>Tchernobyl</b> catastrophe, explosion of the <b>Challenger shuttle</b> live in front of millions of viewers, or the passage of the magnificent <b>Halley's Comet</b> (one revolution every 76 years, it's celebration time!). And if you're into great wine, you should know that the 1986 vintage was absolutely exceptionnal.</p>
    <p>Born in Belgium, I moved several times when I finished high school (everything is on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantombu/">my LinkedIn profile</a> which I use as a centralised CV), before settling up in... <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=puygaillard%20de%20quercy#map=13/44.0327/1.6343">Puygaillard-de-Quercy</a>, in the lost countryside of Occitania, France. This is a small village of 387 living (sort of) people, located about 1h hour from the historic capital of Languedoc: Toulouse!</p>

    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>In my life of <strong>freelance tech lead in Toulouse</strong>, I mostly work with stuff related to the back end:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rust</strong>, with embedded databases (RocksDB, libmdbx), cryptography and distributed systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js</strong> with Koa, Express, Next with a delicious layer of <strong>Typescript</strong> on top of it</li>
      <li>I also had the opportunity to play a bit with Go (Gin, Viper, Cobra, gRPC) and started learning Rust in late 2021</li>
      <li>In another life, I was also working with <b>React</b> and <b>React Native</b> for the Front End and mobile parts, but I'm not interested in working with that anymore</li>
      <li>Aside those barbarian terms, I'm also <a href="https://www.opquast.com/en/">Opquast Expert in Web Quality</a>. The least we can say is that the internetz do needs some <a href="https://checklists.opquast.com/en/">good practices</a>!</li>
      <li>For all of the other skills that I don't master, you can go and check the <a href="https://greaaat.com/">Greaaat freelance network</a> of which I am a member. It's full of top notch people and you won't regret it!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should know too that I exclusively work on <b>remote mission</b> (as a reminder, I live in the countryside, far away from civilization).</p>

    <h2>Let's work together!</h2>
    <p>You can contact me directly on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantombu/">my LinkedIn profile</a> to discuss your project.</p>
    <p><b>Disclaimer :</b> I would be delighted to apply my skills on <b>open source projects</b> organized <b>asynchronously</b> (agile has killed me over the years, I need a new love).</p>

    <h2>Wanna chat?</h2>
    <p>You can find me through the following links, because the phone is so deprecated. Anyway, I don't have cellular network at my work place in the countryside!</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Opensource contributions</h2>
    <p>During my time off, and as we don't have anything else to do in the countryside, I develop open-source projects that no one uses but where I put all my love into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/amazon-alternatives/extension">Amazon Alternatives</a>: a browser extension (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-alternatives/hcjifkchlbbpcpmdbimipoidnljabnai">Chrome</a> &amp; <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-alternatives/">Firefox</a>) that gives you alternatives to Amazon directly on the product pages</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/adriantombu/orion">Orion</a>: a static blog generator made in Go, which I use for <a href="https://blog.otso.fr">my blog</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/adriantombu/packages">A monorepo of NPM packages</a>: a VAT number verificator, a shuffle of arrays, an <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> workflow for <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a>, un Salesforce id converter, ...</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/adriantombu/shush">Shush!</a>: a browser extension (again!) to hide a list of words on several websites. And yes, this definitely started during the Covid-19 overdose.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/adriantombu/otso">The present website</a>: a few HTML pages updated by hand, a favicon and a stylesheet. Certified without any trackers!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The tools I use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>, <a href=" https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=Amazon Alternatives">Webstorm et Goland</a> as code editor / IDE</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.dougs.fr?r=ykmHYYbtKM" title="Affiliated link: 1 free month for each">Dougs</a> for the accounting</li>
      <li><a href="https://qonto.com/r/gs21bf" title="Affiliated link: 10€ each">Qonto</a> for the business account</li>
